              <p>
                Synesxi ("we" or "us") is committed to safeguarding the privacy
                of our users ("you") and managing your data responsibly. This
                Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines how we collect, utilize,
                disclose, and secure your information when you access and
                interact with our platform (the "Platform").

              <p>
                <strong> Strict 18+ Age Requirement: </strong>Our Platform is
                exclusively designed for users aged 18 and above. By accessing
                or utilizing the Platform, you confirm that you meet this age
                requirement and agree to provide any necessary verification upon
                request, such as government-issued identification, to comply
                with applicable laws and regulations, including Know Your
                Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Alternative Verification Methods:</strong> While we may
                utilize age verification services in certain circumstances, we
                recognize the limitations and privacy concerns associated with
                relying solely on social media logins for age verification.
                Therefore, we may offer alternative verification methods, such
                as government-issued identification or partnerships with trusted
                third-party verification providers, to ensure compliance and
                user privacy.
